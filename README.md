# 🚀 Enhanced Fork - DevOps Learning Journey and Practice

This fork represents my personal journey in learning and implementing DevOps practices. I've taken
the original Craftista project and enhanced it with modern DevOps practices and optimizations. Here
are the key improvements:

### 🛠️ Major Enhancements
- **Containerized Architecture**: All services are now containerized with Docker and orchestrated
using Docker Compose
- **Modernized Tech Stack**: 
  - Converted Spring Boot service to FastAPI for better performance
  - Upgraded Flask services to FastAPI for improved reliability
  - Combined related services for better maintainability
- **Enhanced Performance**:
  - Implemented Redis caching
  - Added PostgreSQL database support
  - Optimized service communication

### 📈 Learning Outcomes
This project has helped me gain hands-on experience with:
- Containerization and orchestration
- Microservices architecture optimization
- API development and performance tuning
- Database design and caching strategies
- DevOps best practices
